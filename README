This README file is inteneted to explain the functionalities present in terminal based file explorer and the assumption made while
implementing those.

This document has the following structure:
1. Function name 
2. Function description
3. Assumptions


/---------------------------------------------------------Normal Mode------------------------------------------------------------------/

A.

	1. Diplay directory of root folder (default if not provided). 
	2. File explorer shows each file in the directory (one entry per line). The following attributes are be visible for each file
			i.File Name
			ii.File size (in B)
			iii.Ownership (User & Group) & Permissions
			iv. Last modified (month time in hr:min:ss)
		scrolling is also handled in case where files are more than 20(fixed) in directory.
	3.Path provided by user should be absolute while executing the application.

B.	

	1.Open files & directories.
	2. Files and directory have different handling when enter is pressed (for files default application is opened and fordirectory, list out the files)
		Files- File explorer is able to open files using the corresponding default application using mimelist and and default application.
	3.For files with type .cpp default.ist has entry as ubuntu.sdk(This entry should be gedit.desktop if not file explorer does not open files and
		simply ignores the enter key press)
C
	1.Traversal using arrow keys.
	2. Directories are traversed 
			right arrow key takes forward in diretory onluy if it is already visited.
			Left arrow key and backspace work same taking back into direcotry if visited.
	3. No assumptions.

	
/---------------------------------------------------------Command Mode-------------------------------------------------------------------------/


A.
	1.Copy,Move,rename.
	2.copy files when provide a relative path from root directory of application. format of path is e.g [a-zA-Z]/[a-zA-z]/.....
	3.Assumed destination directory exists and you have write permissions.Files with special permissoins are not handled
		also when while copying file overwrrites file at destination if it preexists with same file name.
		
B. 
	1. Create File,Create Directory,Delet file ,delete directory.
	2. Create file and directory execute the command when path given is relative just as give for copy,move ,rename.
	3. Assumed destination directory exists and you have write permissions.Files with special permissoins are not handled
	   also when while copying to destinaion,file is overwritten if it pre-exists with same name.
C.  
	1.Goto 
	2. Goto pathname take user to typed path which is abolute.Files and directory diplayed if path is valid or error is displayed.
	3. It is to note that to return from goto mode user has to press button 'h' to return home (root directory).
D.
	1.Search
	2.Search recursively looks for paths of all files with given name,file explorer only looks from root directory of an application.
	3.Saerch functionality is losely implemented i.e scrolling is not enabled if one of the search result path is opened.
		To exit search page pressing 'h' key is necessary.

E.
	1.Snapshot
	2. when user gives absolute path of a directory all directory structure os recursively looked up and the this structure is written 
		in dump file in application root directory.
	3.------


To-do:	
	Pressing arrow keys and escape keys is comfusing the application since it is not handled properly both in normal mode and command mode.
